                <h1>The Golden Order has been broken.</h1>
                <p>The Land of Shadow. A place obscured by the Erdtree.
                    Where the goddess Marika first set foot.</p>
                <p>A land purged in an unsung battle.
                    Set ablaze by Messmer&#39;s flame.</p>
                <p>It was to this land that Miquella departed.
                    Divesting himself of his flesh, his strength, his lineage.
                    Of all things Golden.</p>
                <p>And now Miquella awaits the return of his promised Lord. </p>
