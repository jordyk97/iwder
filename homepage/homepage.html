            <p>Rise, Tarnished, and be guided by grace to brandish the power of the Elden Ring and become an Elden Lord in the Lands Between.</p>
            <p>In the Lands Between ruled by Queen Marika the Eternal, the Elden Ring, the source of the Erdtree, has been shattered.</p>
            <p>Marika's offspring, demigods all, claimed the shards of the Elden Ring known as the Great Runes, and the mad
                taint of their newfound strength triggered a war: The Shattering. A war that meant abandonment by the Greater Will.</p>
            <p>And now the guidance of grace will be brought to the Tarnished who were spurned by the grace of gold and exiled from the Lands Between.
                Ye dead who yet live, your grace long lost, follow the path to the Lands Between beyond the foggy sea to stand before the Elden Ring.</p>

                <h1>What is Elden Ring?</h1>
                <p>Elden Ring is a 2022 action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware. It was directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki with worldbuilding provided
                    by fantasy writer George R. R. Martin. It was published for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on February
                    25 by FromSoftware in Japan and Bandai Namco Entertainment internationally. Players control a customizable player character who is on a quest
                    to repair the Elden Ring and become the new Elden Lord.</p>
                <p>Elden Ring is presented through a third-person perspective; players freely roam its interactive open world. The six main areas are traversed
                    using the player character's steed Torrent as the primary mode of travel. Linear, hidden dungeons can be explored to find useful items. Players
                    can use several types of weapons and magic spells, including non-direct engagement enabled by stealth mechanics. Throughout the game's world,
                    checkpoints enable fast travel and allow players to improve their attributes using an in-game currency called runes. Elden Ring features an online
                    multiplayer mode in which players join through cooperative play to fight bosses or engage player-versus-player combat.</p>
                <p>FromSoftware wanted to create an open-world game based on Dark Souls. Miyazaki admired Martin's previous work, and hoped that his contributions
                    would produce a more accessible narrative than those of the company's earlier games. Martin was given unrestricted freedom to design the backstory
                    while Miyazaki was lead writer for the in-game narrative. The developers concentrated on environmental scale, role-playing, and the story; the scale
                    required the construction of several structures inside the open world.</p>
                <p>Elden Ring received critical acclaim for its open world, gameplay systems, and setting, with some criticism for its technical performance. It won
                    several Game of the Year awards and has sold 23 million copies. A downloadable content expansion, Shadow of the Erdtree, is planned to be released
                    in June 2024.</p>
